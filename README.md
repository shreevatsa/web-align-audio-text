Audio/text alignment website.

Just a UI wrapper for the alignment data from https://github.com/avinashvarna/audio_alignment

Work in progress. Currently serving at https://shreevatsa.net/ramayana/

To build, run `hugo serve` (after installing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) from within the `website` directory.
